## Citibike
### By: Stacey Booysen

For this analysis, we are looking into the potential for a bike-rental type business in Des Moines, Iowa, similar to that of the one by Citibike in New York. Our first steps were to gather data from Citibike to get an idea of what types of conditions we need to look into when starting this business. We organized the data to tell a story to the potential investors by showing them the usage rates that could possibly be reflected in Des Moines if this business is implemented. 

### Checkout Times
#### Gender Divided
There is a very particular time frame for the length of time that bikes are ridden, as can be seen below:

As can be seen in the chart below, the checkout times average about 10-20 minutes per person regardless of gender. This suggests that the bikes are mainly used to travel short distances to nearby locations. In this case, the location of available bikes would heavily influence if it is used. If the bikes are near shopping districts, then people are more likely to use them to travel along wide shopping areas.

### Start and End Points
#### Most popular spots
Per the two charts below—the first being start points and the second being end points—we can see that many times the bikes start and end in the same areas. This potentially means that people take the bikes to and from the places they go more often than leaving the bike at their destination as a conclusion to their journey.
In this case, it makes sense that the areas with the highest usage would have the highest amount of both start and end points. These are likely areas where people can make rounds easily enough to allow them to return to their starting point.

### Peak Hours
#### Most Used
In the graph below, we can see that the peak hours for bike usage fall between 6 AM and 10 AM in the mornings, and 4 PM to 6 PM in the evenings. This is especially true on weekdays, suggesting that many use the bikes to commute to and from work in order to avoid traffic. This also implies that they are likely regular customers and therefore subscribers.

The chart below helps to emphasize what was shown earlier—the top hours for trips happen early morning and late evening. We can also see in the chart below, that males are much more likely to travel by bike during these times. This could suggest that men are more likely to commute via bike.

### Subscribers
#### Divided by Gender
Per the below chart, we can see that the majority of the subscribers are in fact male. This helps to reinforce the previous charts that showed that men have a higher tendency to use bikes for traveling around the city.
This could help to predict the number of subscribers in the future. It also helps to determine where it would be best to place more bikes. Areas with higher numbers of males could potentially yield more subscribers.

### More Data to Unpack
#### Other Charts
To further delve into the analysis of this potential business, we could map a line graph to see the increase in usage over the years. This would help to show the popularity of this venture and its ability to increase over time.
Another possible chart could display the start and end points for subscribers only, in order to see the most popular routes that the regular customers take. This could assist in adding more available bikes in those same areas.


### Conclusion
In summary, we found that peak hours are during commutes to and from work, and the gender most likely to subscribe to the Citibike services are male. This will help to figure out where the best bike stations would be and how many should be provided. It will also help with figuring out the level of maintenance for each area based on the potential number of users.

Overall, there is a lot of potential for this venture to work out, so long as the data is kept in mind.
